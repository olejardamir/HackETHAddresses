# HackETHAddresses
Flattened version of key to address

This program is made as a fast and optimized converter of the private keys to public. 
With parallel processing, you can check for one billion private keys per day.

However, even with one billion combinations per day, it would take at least 500-1000 years for the whole human population in the world 
to get one existing key from all the existing keys.

Do not waste electricity on this!

Instead, look at the code, try to improve it or reverse-engineer it going from a public to private.

This code has been tested with only 1000 pairs while refactoring the gibberish from the Ethereum libraries using the bouncy castle libraries...
This means, that it is possible that some private keys won't give the proper public keys, so don't use this code for any serious development, before testing it inside out.

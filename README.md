 
# HackETHAddresses

UPDATE:

The program is done, you may use it in any way you want. The purpose of this program is to answer any doubts concerning the hacking of Ethereum.
The only thing that hasn't been done is transfering this program to a hardware-based solution (microchips) to speed it up. 

HOWEVER!

Although this program checks 10K addresses in 5-10 seconds (per core), assuming the collisions, it takes 173 039 326 821 years (best-case scenario) with a 10 core GPU processor to hack Ethereum, assuming you got 10K addresses on a list. So, you'd need a super-computer about 10 billion times faster or 10 billion cores to get a collision in about 1 year of hacking, or 10 billion more addresses worth hacking (which doesn't exist).

Briefly, you may have more success arguing with an anti-vaxer mom than hacking Ethereum!

This is where I will stop developing, and leave as is.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flattened and somewhat optimized version of web3j, which in my opinion is full of coding crap.

This program is made as a fast and optimized converter of the private keys to public. 


Do not waste electricity on this!

Instead, look at the code, try to improve it or reverse-engineer it going from a public key to a private key.

This code has been tested with only 1000 pairs while refactoring the gibberish from the Ethereum libraries using the bouncy castle libraries...
This means: it is possible that some private keys won't give the proper public keys, so don't use this code for any serious development, before testing it inside out.
